# Action Required: Static Logging Audit & Migration

Hi Cole,

## 🚨 Critical Task: Audit and Convert All Static Logging (printk, BSP_LOG, etc.)

### Background
We have implemented a modular Zephyr logging system, but **direct `printk()` and BSP_LOG calls** are still present in the codebase. These bypass all runtime log control (including `log halt` and `ping_disable`) and are the root cause of persistent UART flooding.

### What Needs To Be Done
- **Search the entire codebase** for:
  - `printk()`
  - `BSP_LOGE`, `BSP_LOGW`, `BSP_LOGI`, `BSP_LOGD`, `BSP_LOGV`
  - Any other static/legacy logging (e.g., `printf`, `puts`, etc.)
- **Convert all of these** to Zephyr LOG macros (`LOG_ERR`, `LOG_WRN`, `LOG_INF`, `LOG_DBG`) and ensure they are:
  - Registered with `LOG_MODULE_REGISTER`
  - Controlled by runtime log level and shell commands
  - (For ping/pong and similar modules) Also respect the `ping_logging_enabled` flag if appropriate
- **Commit and push** your changes so the team can test and continue from a clean, fully controllable logging state.

### Why This Matters
- Direct `printk()`/BSP_LOG calls **bypass all log control** and flood the UART, making debugging and shell usage impossible.
- Zephyr LOG system allows full runtime control, filtering, and shell-based management.

### Example Fix
**Before:**
```c
printk("[PING] Timeout - no pong response\n");
```
**After:**
```c
if (ping_logging_enabled) {
    LOG_WRN("[PING] Timeout - no pong response");
}
```

### Files/Areas to Prioritize
- `src/protobuf_handler.c` (CRITICAL: many printk calls)
- `src/main.c` (printk calls)
- `src/mos_components/mos_lvgl_display/src/mos_lvgl_display.c` (BSP_LOG calls)
- Any other file with static logging

---

## ✅ Next Steps
1. **Audit and convert** all static logging to Zephyr LOG system
2. **Test** that log control (log halt, log go, log level set, ping_disable, etc.) works as expected
3. **Commit and push** your changes
4. **Notify the team** so we can continue testing and development

Thanks!
