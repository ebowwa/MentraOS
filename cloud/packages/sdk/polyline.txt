GMSMapLayer is a custom subclass of CALayer, provided as the layer class on GMSMapView. This layer should not be instantiated directly. It provides model access to the camera normally defined on GMSMapView.

Modifying or animating these properties will typically interrupt any current gesture on GMSMapView, e.g., a user’s pan or rotation. Similarly, if a user performs an enabled gesture during an animation, the animation will stop ‘in-place’ (at the current presentation value).

GMSMapStyle holds details about a style which can be applied to a map.

With style options you can customize the presentation of the standard Google map styles, changing the visual display of features like roads, parks, and other points of interest. As well as changing the style of these features, you can also hide features entirely. This means that you can emphasize particular components of the map or make the map complement the content of your app.

For more information see: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/styling

Declaration

Objective-C


@interface GMSMarker : GMSOverlay
GMSMarkerLayer
GMSMarkerLayer is a subclass of GMSOverlayLayer, available on a per-marker basis, that allows animation of several properties of its associated GMSMarker.

Note that this CALayer is never actually rendered directly, as GMSMapView is provided entirely via an OpenGL layer. As such, adjustments or animations to ‘default’ properties of CALayer will not have any effect.

Declaration
Swift


class GMSOverlay : NSObject, NSCopying
Objective-C


@interface GMSOverlay : NSObject <NSCopying>
GMSOverlayLayer
GMSOverlayLayer is a custom subclass of CALayer, and an abstract baseclass for GMSOverlay layers that allow custom animations.

This is an implementation detail and it should not be instantiated directly.

Declaration

@interface GMSPanoramaService : NSObject
GMSPanoramaView
A panorama is used to display Street View imagery. It should be constructed via [[GMSPanoramaView alloc] initWithFrame:], and configured post-initialization.

All properties and methods should be accessed on the main thread, similar to all UIKit objects. The GMSPanoramaViewDelegate methods will also be called back only on the main thread.

The backgroundColor of this view is shown while no panorama is visible, such as while it is loading or if the panorama is later set to nil. The alpha color of backgroundColor is not supported.

Declaration
Swift


class GMSPanoramaView : UIView
Objective-C


@interface GMSPanoramaView : UIView
GMSPath

@interface GMSPolyline : GMSOverlay
GMSProjection
Defines a mapping between Earth coordinates CLLocationCoordinate2D and coordinates in the map’s view CGPoint. A projection is constant and immutable, in that the mapping it embodies never changes. The mapping is not necessarily linear.

Passing invalid Earth coordinates (i.e., per CLLocationCoordinate2DIsValid) to this object may result in undefined behavior.

This class should not be instantiated directly unless under testing conditions. Instead, obtain it via projection on GMSMapView.

Declaration

Declaration
Swift


class GMSTextureStyle : GMSStampStyle
Objective-C


@interface GMSTextureStyle : GMSStampStyle
GMSSpriteStyle
Describes the drawing style for a stamp image over a GMSStyleSpan.

Note

Only supports transparent background. If any color is set to the GMSStyleSpan it will only be treated as a fallback.

Note

Use of GMSSpriteStyle requires Metal rendering framework. See GMSServices::setMetalRendererEnabled:(BOOL) to learn how to enable Metal. If GMSStyleSpan is added to a map without Metal being enabled, the stamp will not render and instead the polyline span will attempt to fallback to any set color. If no color is set, it will fallback to the default polyline color, [UIColor blueColor].

Note

Use GMSMapView::mapCapabilities property to query if a GMSMapView supports GMSSpriteStyle.

Declaration

Objective-C


@interface GMSSyncTileLayer : GMSTileLayer
GMSTileLayer
GMSTileLayer is an abstract class that allows overlaying of custom image tiles on a specified GMSMapView. It may not be initialized directly, and subclasses must implement the tileForX:y:zoom: method to return tiles.

     return [NSURL URLWithString:URLStr];
   };
   GMSTileLayer *layer =
       [GMSURLTileLayer tileLayerWithURLConstructor:constructor];
   layer.userAgent = @"SDK user agent";
   layer.map = map;
 
GMSURLTileProvider may not be subclassed and should only be created via its convenience constructor.
