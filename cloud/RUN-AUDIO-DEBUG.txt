Audio capture is now ENABLED!

Steps:
======

1. Connect your mobile device to the system
2. Enable the microphone
3. Wait 5 seconds (audio will auto-capture)
4. Run this command:
   
   cd cloud && ./analyze-audio.sh

5. Listen to the two WAV files it creates:
   
   afplay audio-analysis/audio-le.wav
   afplay audio-analysis/audio-be.wav

6. Whichever sounds clear, that's the correct endianness!
   
   If audio-le.wav is clear:
   → Add to .env: LIVEKIT_PCM_ENDIAN=off
   
   If audio-be.wav is clear:
   → Add to .env: LIVEKIT_PCM_ENDIAN=swap

7. Restart: docker-compose restart cloud

Or just wait for the user to connect mobile + mic, then I'll run the analysis automatically.
