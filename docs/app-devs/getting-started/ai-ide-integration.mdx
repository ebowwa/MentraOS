<Info>
**TL;DR** - Get your AI coding assistant to understand MentraOS instantly. Works with Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, and more.
</Info>

## Why Connect Your AI IDE?

When you connect your AI coding assistant to MentraOS docs, it can:

- Answer questions about the MentraOS SDK
- Help you write smart glasses apps faster
- Look up API references automatically
- Debug your code with context about how MentraOS works

## One-Click Setup

### Cursor

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
npx @anthropic-ai/create-mcp -t url https://docs.mentraglass.com/mcp -n mentraos-docs
```

Then **restart Cursor** and you're done.

<Accordion title="What does this do?">
This adds MentraOS docs as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to Cursor. Your AI assistant can now search our docs automatically when you ask questions about MentraOS.
</Accordion>

### Claude Code

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add mentraos-docs --transport http https://docs.mentraglass.com/mcp
```

That's it. Claude Code now has access to MentraOS docs.

<Accordion title="Verify it worked">
Run `claude mcp list` to see your connected servers. You should see `mentraos-docs` in the list.
</Accordion>

### Windsurf / Other MCP-Compatible IDEs

Add this to your MCP configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mentraos-docs": {
      "url": "https://docs.mentraglass.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

<Accordion title="Where is my MCP config file?">
- **Windsurf**: `~/.windsurf/mcp.json`
- **VS Code + Continue**: `~/.continue/config.json`
- **Other tools**: Check your IDE's MCP documentation
</Accordion>

---

## Test It Out

After setup, try asking your AI assistant:

- *"How do I display text on smart glasses with MentraOS?"*
- *"Show me how to use the camera API"*
- *"What events can I listen to in an AppSession?"*

Your AI should now give you accurate, up-to-date answers using our docs.

## MCP Server URL

If you need to configure things manually, here's the URL:

```
https://docs.mentraglass.com/mcp
```

This hosted MCP server gives AI assistants access to search across all MentraOS documentation, code examples, and API references.
